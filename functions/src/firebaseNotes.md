# Simple Security (Check UID or Permissions)

## get-classes-overview

Assuming a user has some basic class info stored in its document, this would be amazing for efficiency

## get-class-roster

If there is a "rosters" collection, this would be easy as hell, just need to make sure the UID is part of the roster
